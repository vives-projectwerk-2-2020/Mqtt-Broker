# Mqtt-Broker
This repository contains the mqtt broker used for realtime data transmission between the lorawan listener and the frontend application.
Currently, the broker will be run on the users localhost, this can be changed by changing the host variable in `broker.js`. 
Same goes for connecting a client or publisher.

## Examples
In the examples map you can find examples of a basic publisher and client integrated in a frontend, the view engine for data in frontend is ejs.
